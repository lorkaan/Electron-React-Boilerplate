A Test to show the easy use of Electron and ReactJS Libraries to make a Desktop Javascript Application.

This is an easy Hello World Application using Electron and ReactJS, using Webpack and Babel.

This is a manually created application without using any boilerplate code or create-react-app npm module.

To get this code, just clone https://github.com/lorkaan/Electron-React-Test.git

The test has two parts, (1) building and (2) running.

    Production Build: 'npm run build'

To run the built program, run 'npm start'
